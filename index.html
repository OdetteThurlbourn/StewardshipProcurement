            <p>We work together with your
                designer, or on board team, to source
                bespoke pieces directly from artisans and
                manufacturers. Multiple quotes obtained,
                wherever possible, including shipping
                and tax considerations to ensure the best
                possible value for your project.
                With capacity to undertake large scale
                projects & the flexibility to source individual pieces
                to your bespoke requirements.
                Each refit or interior refresh is
                unique and we treat each project as such.</p>
